## Introduction

News classification is a common natural language processing (NLP) task that involves training a machine learning model to distinguish between fake and real news articles. This project uses a dataset of labeled news articles to train a Logistic Regression model for classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-classification.git
   cd news-classification

## Usage
- Download the dataset:
Provide the path to your fake and real news datasets in the code where data is loaded.
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

- Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to train the model and evaluate its performance.
Manual Testing:

- Use the manual_testing function to test the model with manually entered news articles.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- jupyter
